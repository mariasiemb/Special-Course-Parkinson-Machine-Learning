# Gait Analysis: IMU-EMG Feature Fusion for Parkinson's Detection

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes gait data from 10 healthy controls (HC) and 10 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. We extract time-domain features from synchronized IMU and EMG signals, then fuse them for machine learning classification.
